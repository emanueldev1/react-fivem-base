## 🎮 How to Install as a FiveM Script

1. **Build the web UI:**
   ```sh
   pnpm run build
   ```
   The output will be in `web/build`.

2. **Do NOT move the build folder.**  
   The resource is already configured to use `web/build` as the NUI root.  
   The `fxmanifest.lua` is set up to use `web/build/index.html` and all assets inside `web/build`.

3. **Resource structure:**  
   Your resource folder should look like this:
   ```
   client/
   server/
   web/
     └─ build/
     └─ src/
   fxmanifest.lua
   ```

4. **Add the resource to your `server.cfg`:**
   ```cfg
   ensure your_resource_name
   ```

## ⚡ Live Coding In-Game (Hot Reload)

You can use the `dev:game` script for live coding and automatic rebuilds while your server is running:

1. **Start the watcher:**
   ```sh
   pnpm run dev:game
   ```
   This will watch for changes and rebuild the UI automatically into `web/build`.

2. **In your FiveM server, refresh the NUI page (usually by reopening the UI or using a reload command) to see your changes instantly, without restarting the server.**

---

## 📝 Customization

- Edit [`web/src/App.jsx`](web/src/App.jsx) to modify the main UI.
- Replace the logo in [`web/src/assets/quasar-logo-with-text.png`](web/src/assets/quasar-logo-with-text.png).
- Add your own hooks, providers, and utilities in their respective folders.
